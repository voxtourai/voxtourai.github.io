Sorrento, perched above the sparkling Bay of Naples, is a town woven with legend, beauty, and centuries of dramatic history. From ancient Greek myths to modern tourism, its streets whisper stories that have enchanted travelers for generations.

## A Glimpse into Sorrento‚Äôs Past

Did you know that the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus claimed Sorrento was founded by **Liparus**, the same figure who founded Lipari? According to myth, **three sirens** settled on the cliffs of Sorrento, luring sailors to their doom with beautiful song, a myth even **Ulysses** had to resist.

Over the centuries, Sorrento fell under the rule of **Ostrogoths, Byzantines, Saracens**, and **Spanish**, before finally joining the **Kingdom of Italy in 1861**. The town flourished, attracting literary and artistic giants like **Goethe, Byron, Wagner, Keats, Ibsen**, and **Dickens**. Today, it continues to charm with its mix of ancient culture, artisan craft, and stunning coastal views.

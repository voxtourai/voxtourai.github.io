At **VoxTour**, we believe that every city has a story to tell and the best way to hear it is by walking its streets with a local voice in your ear.

Weâ€™re thrilled to announce two major milestones:

âœ… The release of **three brand-new audio walking tours** in *Phoenix, Denver, and Colorado Springs*  
âœ… The official launch of the **VoxTour mobile app**, now available for both **iOS** and **Android**

Whether you're planning a weekend getaway or looking for a new way to explore your hometown, VoxTour is now easier and more accessible than ever before.

## Say Hello to the VoxTour App

After months of development, feedback, and testing, weâ€™re proud to launch the official **VoxTour app**, your all-in-one companion for immersive, self-guided exploration.

Available on both the **App Store** and **Google Play**, the app lets you:

- Browse and preview tours
- Navigate easily using GPS
- Access offline audio guides
- Get background info on each stop
- Move at your own pace, pause, skip, or replay anytime

Our goal was to remove the stress of group tours and create something truly flexible. With the VoxTour app, **youâ€™re in control of your journey** with high-quality narration and curated routes guiding the way.


## 3 New Tours, 3 Unique Stories

With the app launch, weâ€™re also introducing **three exciting new audio tours** that spotlight iconic and off-the-beaten-path locations across the American Southwest.

### Phoenix: Urban Art, Architecture & Desert Vibes

**Perfect for:** street art lovers, urban explorers, and fans of warm desert strolls.


### Denver: Mile-High History & Cultural Icons

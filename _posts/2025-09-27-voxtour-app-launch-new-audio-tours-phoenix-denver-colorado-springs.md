At **VoxTour**, we believe that every city has a story to tell and the best way to hear it is by walking its streets with a local voice in your ear.

We’re thrilled to announce two major milestones:

Whether you're planning a weekend getaway or looking for a new way to explore your hometown, VoxTour is now easier and more accessible than ever before.

## Say Hello to the VoxTour App

After months of development, feedback, and testing, we’re proud to launch the official **VoxTour app**, your all-in-one companion for immersive, self-guided exploration.

Available on both the **App Store** and **Google Play**, the app lets you:

- Browse and preview tours
- Navigate easily using GPS
- Access offline audio guides
- Get background info on each stop
- Move at your own pace, pause, skip, or replay anytime

Our goal was to remove the stress of group tours and create something truly flexible. With the VoxTour app, **you’re in control of your journey** with high-quality narration and curated routes guiding the way.


## 3 New Tours, 3 Unique Stories

With the app launch, we’re also introducing **three exciting new audio tours** that spotlight iconic and off-the-beaten-path locations across the American Southwest.

## Start & Listen to a Tour

Once you choose a tour, VoxTour.ai makes it easy to preview the route, review stops, and start listening at your own pace.

---

### Step 1: Open the tour page

From the city screen, tap or click **Open** on any tour card.

The tour page shows:
- Tour overview and description
- Rating and available audio languages
- Estimated walking distance and duration
- Number of included stops
- Full list of Points of Interest (POIs)

---

### Step 2: Choose your listening language

On the tour page, select your preferred audio language.

Tap or click the language selector next to the **Start Tour** button.  
Available languages may include English, Hebrew, Russian, and others depending on the tour.

---

### Step 3: Open a tour and view stops

Tap or click **Start Tour** (or open a tour page).

If you are not signed in, VoxTour.ai will prompt you to sign in or create an account before continuing.

Opening a tour does **not start audio automatically.**  
Instead, VoxTour.ai displays the **list of stops (locations)** included in the tour.

Each stop displays:
- Stop number and name
- Photo preview
- **Visit** button (opens location details and audio story)
- **Direction** button (opens navigation to the stop)

You can explore stops in order or jump to any location.

### Step 4: Preview the tour route on the map


#### On mobile:
Tours include a **Route icon** (map/book icon). Tapping the Route icon opens the map centered on **your current location**.

This means:
- If you are currently in a different country, the route may not be immediately visible.
- You may need to manually zoom or move the map to view the full route.

The same behavior applies when tapping **Direction** - navigation is based on your current location.

#### On desktop:
The map appears alongside the tour content.

This makes it easier to:
- View the entire tour route
- Understand stop locations
- Explore the path even if you are not physically in the destination city

---

### Step 5: Start listening at a stop

To begin listening:

Tap or click **Visit** next to a stop.

When you select **Visit**, VoxTour.ai:
- Opens the stop page
- Launches the audio player
- Starts the story for that location

You can start from any stop, you do not have to follow the route in order.

### Step 6: Use directions to navigate

The **Direction** button helps you navigate to a stop using map navigation.

**On mobile:**
- Directions may open navigation based on your current location.

**On desktop:**
- You can preview the stop location and route on the map before traveling.

---

### Step 7: Use the audio player

While listening, you can:

- Pause or resume playback
- Skip forward or backward between stops
- Adjust playback speed
- Continue exploring the map while listening

You can stop and resume the tour anytime.

---

### Step 8: Explore stops during the tour

While following the tour, you can:
- Open the map to see upcoming stops
- Select stops manually
- Read descriptions and view images
- Use navigation directions between locations

---

### Flexible listening experience

With VoxTour.ai, you can:

- Follow the tour route step-by-step
- Visit stops in any order
- Pause and continue later
- Combine guided tours with spontaneous exploration

---

**Tip:**  
Before starting a tour, preview the route on desktop or zoom out on mobile to better understand the full walking path.

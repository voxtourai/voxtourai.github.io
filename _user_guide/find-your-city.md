## Find Your City & Tours

VoxTour.ai lets you explore cities in a flexible way.  
You can discover **curated tours** or explore **individual points of interest (POIs)** directly from the map.

You can browse cities, tours, and places without signing in.  
To listen to audio stories, you’ll need to sign in.

---

### Step 1: Search for a city

**On desktop:**  
On the home page, use the **Search by destination** field to enter a city name (for example, *Rome* or *Paris*), then select it from the results.

**On mobile:**  
Tap the search field, type a city name, and select it from the list.

### Step 2: Explore the city map

After selecting a city, you’ll see:
- a **map** with numbered and icon-based POIs
- a **list of available tours** for that city

The map and the tour list work together, you can explore visually or browse tours first.

### Step 3: Explore individual places (POIs)

You don’t have to follow a tour to explore.

Tap or click any **POI icon** on the map to open a place preview.  
Each POI preview shows:
- place name and category
- rating (if available)
- available audio languages
- a short description

This is ideal if you want to:
- explore freely
- listen only to places nearby
- stop and play audio whenever something catches your eye

### Step 4: Browse tours in the list

The tour list shows curated routes created to help you explore a city around a theme or area.

Each tour card includes:
- **Tour title**
- **Rating**
- **Estimated duration**
- **Total distance**
- **Number of stops (locations)**

These details help you quickly compare tours and choose one that fits your time and walking preferences.

---

### Step 5: Check available languages

Next to the tour rating, you may see one or more **language icons** (for example 🇺🇸 🇫🇷 🇮🇹).

These icons indicate the languages in which the tour audio is available.  
Choose a tour that matches the language you want to listen in.

---

### Step 6: Preview the tour route on the map

Tours include a **route icon** (map/book icon) next to the **Open** button.

Tap or click this icon to:
- display the full tour route on the map
- see how all tour stops are connected
- understand the walking path before starting

This is helpful if you want to check distances, walking direction, or how the tour fits into your plans.

### Step 7: Open a tour

Select **Open** to view the full tour page.

From there, you can:
- see all included locations
- check detailed tour information
- choose your listening language
- start the tour after signing in

---

### Choose how you want to explore

With VoxTour.ai, you can:
- follow a **complete tour** from start to finish
- listen to **individual POIs** in any order
- combine both approaches depending on your mood and time

---

**Tip:**  
If you’re short on time, explore nearby POIs.  
If you want a deeper, guided experience, choose a tour and follow its route at your own pace.

Tap on any point or tour to preview what’s available.  
You can freely explore the map and see tour details without logging in.

When you’re ready to listen, sign in or create an account.  
This unlocks audio playback and lets you save your progress and favorites.

### Step 4: Press Play
Select a tour or an individual audio point and tap **Play** ▶️.  
Listen at your own pace in any order, wherever you are.
**Tip:**  
Most tours are available in multiple languages. You can choose the tour language before starting playback.

**Q:** Why doesn’t the tour start automatically?

**A:** In VoxTour.ai, tours are designed to give you full flexibility. Opening a tour does not start audio automatically because you can choose where and how to begin listening.

To start listening, you need to:

1. Open the tour page
2. Select a stop from the list
3. Tap or click **Visit**
4. The audio player will open and the story will begin

This allows you to start from any stop and explore tours in any order.

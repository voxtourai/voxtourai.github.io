**Q:** Can I listen to VoxTour offline?

**A:** Yes. You can listen to VoxTour tours offline if you open the tour while you still have an internet connection. The tour is then cached on your phone.

The last opened tour is saved on your device for up to one month.

A minimal internet connection may still be required for certain features, but even a free eSIM or basic mobile data is usually sufficient.

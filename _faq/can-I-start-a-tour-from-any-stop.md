**Q:** Can I start a tour from any stop?

**A:** Yes, VoxTour.ai allows you to start a tour from any stop. Tours are designed to be flexible, so you can listen in any order based on your location or preferences.

To start from any stop:

1. Open the tour page
2. Browse the list of stops
3. Tap or click **Visit** next to the stop you want
4. The audio story for that location will begin

This makes it easy to join a tour even if you are already near a specific location.

**Q:** Can I use VoxTour before traveling to a city?

**A:** Yes, you can use VoxTour.ai before arriving at your destination. You can explore cities, browse available tours, and preview points of interest from anywhere.

Before traveling, you can:

- Search and explore destinations
- Preview tour routes and stops
- Read descriptions of points of interest
- Choose preferred tours in advance
- Plan your travel itinerary

However, some features such as Navigator require you to be physically near locations to automatically trigger stories.
